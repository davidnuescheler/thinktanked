## üéØ Tips

### General Tips
- Time your jumps carefully to land on platforms

- When flying, hold Space/‚Üë to go up, release to glide down gracefully
- Use flying power-ups to reach hard-to-access gems and skip dangerous sections
- **Look for spotted cheetahs** üêÜ - they activate slow-motion mode!
- In slow-motion, enemies move at half speed while you maintain full speed
- Use slow-motion to safely navigate through enemy-dense areas and obstacles
- **Avoid spikes at all costs** - they're deadly!
- You can jump on wooden crates to use them as platforms
- Jump over brick blocks or find alternate routes around them
- Collect all gems for maximum score
- Watch out for enemy patrol patterns
- Each level gets progressively more challenging as you advance

### Level 2 Specific Tips
- **Mind the gaps!** Level 2 has pits in the ground - don't fall in!
- The star character can jump the same height, but you'll need perfect timing
- Enemies move faster (1.0x vs 0.75x) - use slow-motion cheetahs strategically
- Platforms are smaller and farther apart - patience is key
- Flying kitties are higher up and harder to reach, but worth the effort!
